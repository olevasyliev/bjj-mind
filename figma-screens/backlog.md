## Future tracks (not in White Belt path) 🗂️
- [ ] **Self-Defense Track** — separate learning mode (not part of belt progression)
  - Covers techniques 1-30: striking defense, T-position throws, lapel grabs, bear hugs, headlocks
  - ~30 questions, ~40 min gameplay
  - Reason: self-defense is a different context/mindset from sport BJJ ground game

## Future belt content 📚
- [ ] **Blue→Purple curriculum**
  - Source: https://bjjmechanics.com/p/sauer-jiu-jitsu-blue-to-purple-curriculum (PSBJJA, $100 course)
  - 88 techniques covering: sweeps (spider guard, half guard, star sweep, kickover), submissions (omoplata, ankle locks, knee bars, lapel chokes), knee-on-stomach escapes, knife defenses
  - Same Pedro Sauer association — consistent with our White→Blue source
